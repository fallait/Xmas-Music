    <h4>Team Members: Joseph Fallait, Andres Fernandez, Yun Tong</h4>
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      As the advent the Christmas season, we want to explore historical data of Billboard top 100 Chirstmas songs and have the users be engaged during this process.
    </p>
    <h2>Data Processing</h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We first inspected the datasets and found out that out of 387 songs, there is data for 320 of them.
        </li>
        <li>
          SONGS and LYRICS data was subsequently updated to make up for the broken song id and for ease of use. Here are the changes:
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Design Processes</h2>
    <h4>
      Types of Visualization
  </h4>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Heatmap: Billboard Top 100 Ranked Holiday songs by decade (tooltip to show title, artist and rank)</li>
        <li>Bar chart: most frequent words in the song clicked on from the heatmap</li>
        <li>Word cloud: similar to the bar chart, shows most frequent words in the song previously clicked on while visualizing the frequency by size instead of length</li>
        <li>Node-link diagram: shows songs in which the chosen word exist (from the bar chart or the word cloud)</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
    <h4>
      Decision Making Process (on Types of Vis to Use)
    </h4>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Heatmap was our top choice for visualizing the top song since it is great for displaying 3 variables at the same time (song title, year, ranking).</li>
        <li>Heatmap is also ideal for on-click interactions since the squares offer larger area for user to click on than, for example, a line chart.</li>
        <li>Bar chart was almost a given when we started the project since bar charts are clear and efficient in visualizing a 2-variable subset.</li>
        <li>Word cloud was a natural choice when we decided to build a vis with lyrics.</li>
        <li>Node-link diagram was inspired by the idea of decorating a Christmas tree with the nodes as ornaments.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
    <h4>
      Struggles
    </h4>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>We were blindsided by the lack of lyrics data since in the beginning it looked sufficient as the dataset was large.</li>
        <li>Being in different timezones made communication less efficient.</li>
        <li>Initially we had a hard time enabling the nodes to move around while being confined in a designated SVG.</li>
        <li>Glitch sometimes times out under multiple requests which didn't happen on our previous project.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
    <h4>
      Lessons Learned
    </h4>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Merging and working with two datasets and perform interactions among the visualizations</li>
        <li>Initial data cleaning</li>
        <li>Making heatmap and word cloud</li>
        <li>Drawing labels on top of the force diagram (we had to update them every frame by using d3.call())</li>
        <li>Adding interactions between all interactions presented some challenge</li>
        <li>Scrolling the page to a new section on click of a vis</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
